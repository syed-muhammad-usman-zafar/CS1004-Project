# Minesweeper-
Upon running enter any key and a menu will appear for game movements, specify row then press enter and then column.
When you select a level you will see two boards, one is where mines are randomly generated and the other is the board you play on
you can choose not to display the MINE BOARD by commenting out code on line 420 that is :

		// MINES JAB SHOW NAI KRANI YE COMMENT OUT KRDENA
		cout << endl << endl;
		cout << "data board:" << endl;
		showMines(dataBoard);
		cout << endl << endl;

  happy coding :)
